### Blackquotes

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

   ### Paragraphs

   We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.  

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

 
 ## Exercise 2

 >**Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)** is part of the family of _XML_ markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used _HyperText Markup Language (HTML)_, the language in which Web pages are formulated.
 >**XHTML** 1.0 became a _World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)_ recommendation on 26 January 2000. The standard known as **XHTML5** is being developed as an _XML_ adaptation of the **HTML5** specification.

 >**KML** was originally developed for use with _Google Earth_ which was originally known as **Keyhole Earth Viewer**. **KLM** was adopted as international standard in 2008 by the Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008. Since the format was developed for use with Google Earth, it has the distinction to be the first one to view and edit KML files. With the passage of time, there are now more and more projects that provide support for **KML** file formats including several APIs in different languages.
 >**KML, Keyhole Markup Language** contains geospatial information in _XML_ notation. Files saved as **KML** can be opened in Geographic Information System (_GIS_) applications provided they support it. Many applications have started providing support for **KML** file format after it has been adopted as international standard. **KML** uses a tag-based structure with nested elements and attributes. All the tags are case-sensitive and the order of these tags, as per **KML** Reference, is important to follow.

```ruby:

  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }
  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }
  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
